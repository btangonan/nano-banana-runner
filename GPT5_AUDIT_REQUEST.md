# 🔍 Nano Banana Runner - Comprehensive Code Audit Request

**Project**: Nano Banana Runner (AI Image Generation Pipeline)  
**Repository**: https://github.com/btangonan/nano-banana-runner  
**Audit Date**: 2025-09-08  
**Audit Type**: Security, Architecture, Performance, Compliance  
**Priority**: HIGH - Pre-Phase 2 Implementation Review

---

## 📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Project Overview
Nano Banana Runner is an AI-powered image generation pipeline that analyzes source images, remixes their attributes into creative prompts, and generates new images using Google's Vertex AI (Imagen-3). The system emphasizes style-only conditioning to prevent copyright violations while maximizing creative output.

### Current Status
- **Phase 1**: ✅ COMPLETE - Core infrastructure, image analysis, web GUI
- **Phase 2**: 🔄 PLANNED - Prompt remixing, AI integration
- **Phase 3**: ⏳ PLANNED - Production features, advanced controls

### Audit Urgency
Before proceeding with Phase 2 (AI integration), we need comprehensive validation of:
1. Security architecture (especially for AI prompt injection)
2. Cost control mechanisms (prevent runaway spending)
3. Style-only conditioning effectiveness (legal compliance)
4. Performance at scale (1000+ images)
5. Code quality and technical debt

### Design Principles ("Vibe" Coding)
1. **Small, Composable Slices**: All files ≤300 LOC
2. **Typed + Validated Everything**: Zod schemas with `.strict()`
3. **Secrets Stay Secret**: ADC-only, no keys in code
4. **Minimal State**: Filesystem as source of truth
5. **Fail Fast, Loud, Recover**: RFC 7807 errors, exponential backoff

  - src/adapters/geminiImage.ts [TODO]
  - proxy/src/routes/*.ts
```

#### 1.2 Input Validation & Sanitization
```yaml
Concerns:
  - Prompt injection attacks via image analysis
  - Path traversal in file operations
  - XSS in GUI components
  - SQL injection (future database)

Review:
  - All Zod schemas in src/types.ts
  - File upload handling in ui.upload.ts
  - Prompt generation in core/remix.ts [TODO]
```

#### 1.3 Secrets Management
```yaml
Current State:
