# Bug Fix Summary - September 10, 2025

## Overview
Fixed critical issues preventing generated images from displaying in the Gallery component and improved error handling for partial generation failures.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Gallery Display Bug (Critical)

#### Problem
- Gallery showed "0 generated images" despite backend successfully generating images
- Users couldn't see their generated images even though they existed on disk
- API returned correct data but Gallery component failed to display it

#### Root Causes
1. **Overly strict filtering logic** - Gallery required `searchTerm` to exist, filtering out all items when empty
2. **React Query cache issues** - Stale data cached from previous empty states
3. **JobId propagation failure** - JobId not properly passed from SubmitMonitor to Gallery component

#### Solution
```typescript
// 1. Fixed filtering to handle empty search
const matchesSearch = !searchTerm || item.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())

// 2. Disabled React Query caching
queryOptions: {
  staleTime: 0,  // Don't cache results
  gcTime: 0,      // Remove from cache immediately
}

// 3. Fixed jobId propagation in App.tsx
<SubmitMonitor
  onNext={(completedJobId?: string) => {
    if (completedJobId) setJobId(completedJobId)
    setCurrentStep(3)
  }}
/>
<Gallery jobId={jobId} />
```

### 2. Silent Image Generation Failures

#### Problem
- When uploading 3 images, sometimes only 2 would generate
- Missing images (e.g., image_1) with no clear error message
- Users only saw vague "1 files had issues" warning

#### Root Cause
- Gemini API failures for individual images (rate limits, content filters, network issues)
- Error handling caught failures but didn't report which image failed or why

#### Solution
```typescript
// Improved error reporting with specific image identification
catch (error) {
  console.error(`Failed to generate image_${i}_variant_${v}:`, error);
  job.problems.push({
    title: `Image generation failed for image_${i}_variant_${v}`,
    detail: error instanceof Error ? error.message : "Unknown error",
    instance: `image_${i}_variant_${v}`
  });
}

// Better upload warning messages
toast({
  title: 'Upload warnings',
  description: `${data.warnings.length} file(s) had issues: ${warningDetails}`,
  variant: 'warning',
})
```

## Testing & Verification

### Verified Working
- ✅ Gallery displays all generated images correctly
- ✅ JobId properly propagates through component hierarchy  
- ✅ Images are generated and saved to disk (`/outputs/[jobId]/`)
- ✅ API returns correct data structure with image items
- ✅ Error messages now identify specific failed images

### Test Cases
1. **Job 54445ef7**: 10/10 images generated successfully
2. **Job 1d8cbd0a**: 2/3 images (image_1 failed - now properly reported)
3. **Job b33ba8b9**: 3/3 images generated successfully

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `apps/nn/apps/gui/src/pages/Gallery.tsx` - Fixed filtering logic, disabled caching
- `apps/nn/apps/gui/src/App.tsx` - Fixed jobId propagation
- `apps/nn/apps/gui/src/pages/SubmitMonitor.tsx` - Updated onNext callback
- `apps/nn/apps/gui/src/pages/UploadAnalyze.tsx` - Improved warning messages

### Backend
- `apps/nn/proxy/src/clients/geminiBatch.ts` - Better error logging for failed images

## Lessons Learned

1. **Don't assume empty states** - Filtering logic should handle undefined/empty values gracefully
2. **Cache invalidation is hard** - Sometimes disabling cache is better than stale data
3. **Be specific with errors** - Generic "X files had issues" is not helpful
4. **Component communication** - Ensure props are properly passed through component hierarchy
5. **Silent failures are bad** - Always log and report specific failures to users

## Current Status
✅ All issues resolved and tested
✅ Images are being generated successfully
✅ Gallery displays images correctly
✅ Error reporting provides actionable information
