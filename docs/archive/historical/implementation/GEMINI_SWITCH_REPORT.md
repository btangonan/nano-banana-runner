# Switch from Imagen to Gemini 2.5 Flash - Implementation Report

**Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Requested by**: User  
**Reason**: "image is bad" - Image quality issues with Imagen 3.0

## Summary
Successfully switched image generation from Imagen 3.0 to Gemini 2.5 Flash as requested by the user due to quality concerns.

## Changes Made

### 1. Model Configuration
- **Previous Model**: `imagen-3.0-generate-002`
- **New Model**: `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`

### 2. API Endpoint Update
- **Previous**: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/images/generations`
- **New**: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview:generateContent`

### 3. Request Format Changes
**Previous (OpenAI-compatible format)**:
```json
{
  "model": "imagen-3.0-generate-002",
  "prompt": "...",
  "response_format": "b64_json",
  "n": 1
}
```

**New (Native Gemini format)**:
```json
{
  "contents": [{
    "parts": [
      {"text": "..."},
      {"inline_data": {...}}  // for reference images
    ]
  }]
}
```

### 4. Response Parsing Update
- Changed from extracting `body.data[0].b64_json`
- To extracting `body.candidates[0].content.parts[].inline_data.data`

### 5. Header Changes
- **Previous**: `Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}`
- **New**: `x-goog-api-key: {API_KEY}`

## Files Modified
- `/apps/nn/proxy/src/clients/geminiBatch.ts`: Updated `generateSingleImage()` method

## Testing Results

### Test Images Generated
1. **Gemini 2.5 Flash**: `gemini-2.5-flash-test.png` (1.5MB)
2. **Imagen 3.0**: `imagen-3.0-test.png` (1.3MB)

Both models successfully generated images with the same prompt: "Create a picture of a nano banana dish in a fancy restaurant with a Gemini theme"

## Key Improvements

### 1. Native Reference Image Support
Gemini 2.5 Flash now supports reference images directly in the API request as `inline_data` parts, whereas Imagen required workarounds with text descriptions.

### 2. Better Integration
The native Gemini API format allows for more sophisticated multimodal inputs, combining text and images seamlessly.

### 3. Model Capabilities
Gemini 2.5 Flash is specifically designed for image generation with the `-image-preview` variant, offering dedicated image generation capabilities.

## API Key Compatibility
The existing API key (`AIzaSyBYekAymMYfkh3OmVJKAU8LMbeU4JGYnwo`) works with both models, confirming it's a Google AI Studio key with access to multiple models.

## Next Steps
1. Monitor image quality feedback from user
2. Update documentation to reflect Gemini 2.5 Flash as the primary model
3. Consider implementing model selection in configuration for flexibility

## Notes
- The switch was made per user request due to image quality concerns
- Both models remain accessible with the same API key
- The proxy service continues to work seamlessly with the new model
